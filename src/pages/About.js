        <p className="text-gray-700">
          MGI Smart Play was founded with a vision to support children's learning through hands-on,
          meaningful play. We saw a gap in the market for educational toys that are not only fun and
          safe, but also made with love and sustainability in mind. From humble beginnings in our
          local workshop, we've grown into a brand trusted by parents, teachers, and caregivers
          across Tanzania.
